**Bank Customer Clustering.ipynb**
   - **Topic:** Unveiling Trends in Bank Customer Characteristics by Segmentation
   - **Description:** This notebook explores and analyzes bank customer data, applying clustering techniques to unveil patterns and trends in customer characteristics. After grouping into 3 clusters, this was the inference:

Cluster 1: The Established Couples

The first cluster contains a group that is distinguished by its stability and dedication. With a mean age of 41.4, these clientele are mostly married, indicating a feeling of financial responsibility. With an acceptable average balance, they participate in more campaigns, preferring short to medium call durations. Their preferred communication method is cellular, and their housing and loan choices are spread out.

Cluster 2: The Emerging Independents

Moving on to the second cluster, we find a slightly younger demographic with an average age of 40.8. This category, which includes people of various marital statuses, has a moderate financial situation with a balance comparable to the first. Their campaign participation is consistent with the first cluster, with a preference for shorter call durations. Cellular communication is prioritised, and one prominent trait is a higher probability of owning a mortgage.

Cluster Three: The Savvy and Diverse Investors

With a mean age of 42.1, the last cluster reveals a somewhat older and more educated consumer. They stand out financially with a greater average balance. Campaign participation is reasonable, and communication choices range among cellphone and telephone mediums. Marital status reflects a mix of partnered and unmarried people, whereas housing loan trends show a higher likelihood than the first two groupings.
